## ✅ TRANSFORMATION COMPLETE

- Clean, intentional, designed
- "Horror game poster" energy

### AFTER (Institutional)
- OCR-style fonts (machine-readable, bureaucratic)
- DIN Condensed style (government signage)
- "Classified document" energy

## 🔧 KEY ADJUSTMENTS

### 1. Removed Bold Everywhere
**Why:** OCR and institutional fonts should not be bold.  
**Effect:** Feels utilitarian, not designed.

### 2. Increased Letter Spacing
**Why:** Government/archival material has mechanical spacing.  
**Effect:** Feels stamped, typed, scanned.

### 3. Reduced Glow Intensity
**Before:** `0 0 20px, 0 0 40px`  
**After:** `0 0 15px, 0 0 30px`  
**Why:** Less "neon sign", more "emergency lighting".

### 4. Smaller System Text
**Before:** 0.85rem  
**After:** 0.75rem  
**Why:** Machine status should be quiet, not dramatic.

### 5. Tighter Subtitle
**Before:** 0.15em spacing  
**After:** 0.08em spacing  
**Why:** DIN Condensed style - tight, industrial.

## 🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

### SCP/Found Footage Typography Rules:

✅ **Imperfect Authority**  
   - Looks official, but slightly wrong
   - OCR fonts suggest machine reading

✅ **Mechanical, Not Stylish**  
   - No designer would choose these fonts
   - They were chosen for function

✅ **Feels Scanned/Typed/Stamped**  
   - Wide letter spacing = typewriter/OCR
   - Monospace = machine output

✅ **Suggests Documentation**  
   - Not a game title
   - An archival classification

---

## 🚫 WHAT WAS AVOIDED

❌ Pixel fonts (too video game)  
❌ VHS novelty fonts (too cosplay)  
❌ Horror display fonts (too theatrical)  
❌ Handwritten fonts (too personal)  
❌ Distressed fonts (trying too hard)

**SCP horror comes from restraint.**

## 📊 TYPOGRAPHY COMPARISON

```
JetBrains Mono → Share Tech Mono (OCR-B style)
  "Modern dev terminal" → "Government ID card"

Bold 700 → Regular 400
  "Designed for impact" → "Utilitarian default"

0.2em spacing → 0.25em spacing
  "Aesthetic choice" → "Mechanical necessity"

Soft glow (20px/40px) → Sharp glow (15px/30px)
  "Neon sign" → "Emergency indicator"
```

## 🎯 THE CORE QUESTION

**Before:** Does this feel like a game brand?  
**After:** Does this feel like a document I wasn't meant to see?

**Answer:** ✅ DOCUMENT ACHIEVED

---

## 🔮 OPTIONAL NEXT LEVEL (Not Implemented Yet)

If you want to push it further:

1. **Slight Baseline Wobble**
   - 1-2px vertical offset on random letters
   - Mimics bad scan / re-recording

2. **Per-Character Opacity Variance**
   - 1-2% opacity difference per letter
   - Suggests tape damage

3. **Classification Header**
   - Add small text above title:
   - "DOCUMENT RECOVERY: 1993-NM-047"
   - OCR font, 0.6rem, red

4. **Redaction Bar**
   - Black bar with [REDACTED] on hover
   - SCP classic move

**Do NOT animate aggressively. Subtle only.**

## 🌐 TEST IT NOW

**URL:** http://localhost:5000

**What to Look For:**

1. **Title** feels stamped, not designed
2. **Subtitle** feels like a classification line
3. **System text** feels like machine output
4. **Overall** feels like recovered evidence

**Compare:** Does it feel more like:
- A horror game website? ❌
- A leaked government file? ✅

## 📝 FONT SOURCES

**Current (Web Fonts):**
- Share Tech Mono (Google Fonts) - OCR-B substitute
- Courier Prime (Google Fonts) - Fallback
- Inter (Google Fonts) - Body copy

**If You Want True OCR-B:**
```

**If You Want True DIN:**
```
Download DIN Condensed
Or use Helvetica Neue Condensed (macOS default)
```

Current setup uses widely available substitutes that achieve 90% of the effect.

## ✅ WHAT WORKS NOW

- ✓ Title feels institutional
- ✓ Subtitle feels bureaucratic
- ✓ System text feels mechanical
- ✓ Buttons feel utilitarian
- ✓ Overall tone: recovered material

## 🎬 FINAL VERDICT

**Typography Shift: COMPLETE**

**Energy:** From "designed horror poster" → "classified archive leak"

**Next:** Test it. If it feels right, you're done.

**If you want to push harder:**
- Add classification metadata
- Implement subtle imperfections
- Add redaction bars

**But honestly?** This is already institutional. The shift is complete.

**"Recording in progress."** ← Now feels like a machine wrote it. Perfect.
